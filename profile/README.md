Origami Technology is pioneering the future of green cloud services by harnessing the power of the ocean. Our innovative system transforms marine energy into electrical power and computational resources, creating a decentralized, redundant, and sustainable cloud infrastructure.

## üåä Overview

We are developing the first fully green cloud service‚Äîa network of interconnected devices powered by wave energy. These devices form a distributed server network that provides scalable cloud services, including data storage and computational power, all while being environmentally sustainable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Device

The core of our system is a Wave Energy Converter (WEC), consisting of two buoys that move with the sea waves. This motion generates electricity and powers onboard servers with up to 600 TB of storage per device. Additionally, each device is equipped with a water cooling system to maintain optimal performance.

## üåê Connection

To ensure continuous data flow, devices communicate through a mesh network, relaying information to ground stations via high-performance antennas. For remote locations, satellite communication serves as a backup, ensuring global connectivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Internal Repositories

To support our development efforts, we maintain several internal repositories:

- **Capitone**: A physics simulation tool for modeling wave energy dynamics.
- **Origami-web**: The frontend for our website and user interfaces.
- **Mechanism**: CAD models and design files for the transmission system and external components.
- **Polpo**: Software for controlling electronics and actuators.
- **Infra**: A lightweight infrastructure for rapid development and testing.

## üöÄ Roadmap

Our journey includes:

- **Prototype Development**: Building and testing the first fully functional node.
- **Network Expansion**: Deploying multiple nodes to form a scalable network.
- **Service Deployment**: Offering cloud services to clients with high availability and security.
